    My Objectives for the Game Art and Animation Major
    <ol>
        <div>
            <li id="objTitle"> Communicate aesthetic skills and choices based on traditional art theories and current
                game
                development practices and next generation research.</li>
            <div>paragraph description goes here</div>

            <li id="objTitle"> Conceptualize and generate pre-production art assets through pre-visualization and
                prototypes usable for
                multiple game platforms.</li>
            <div>paragraph description goes here</div>

            <li id="objTitle"> Demonstrate the core skills needed to create 2D and 3D art assets, textures, and
                animations utilizing
                industry-standard software tools.</li>
            <p>I created a webpage using the Document Object Model to display data from a UAT Space Launch.
                The raw data is contained in the dataLoader.js file. The table loads and displays data in 10 second
                incriments when the start button is depressed.

            <li id="objTitle"> Create industry quality 2D and 3D art assets (such as characters, props, textures,
                environment elements,
                and
                collision objects) or animations (keyframed and motion capture character, environmental and FX) for use
                in
                game projects utilizing

                2D
                and 3D game projects working within a production pipeline and the confines of a projectâ€™s game engine,
                tools
